Dragonmarked Houses are powerful family guilds in the world of Eberron, each tied to a magical dragonmarkâ€”a mystical sigil that appears on their members and grants unique magical abilities. These houses dominate various industries (like healing, travel, or communication) and wield significant economic and political influence across the continent.
