**The Last War**

For hundrads of years the continent of [[02 - World/Continents/Main Continent/Khorvaire\|Khorvaire]] was untied under the kingdom of Galifar. Before the death of King Jarot in 894 YK, there was peace. Following the passing of King Jarot the five nations spiraled into war. The Last War was a bitter struggle that forever changed [[02 - World/Continents/Main Continent/Khorvaire\|Khorvaire]]. For a century of backend alliances and a bloody stalemates with periods of brutal battles. The conflict would leave scars deeper than anyone could imagine. On 20 Olarune 994 YK, the nation of [[Cyre\|Cyre]] was consumed by a magical cataclysm now known as the [[02 - World/Mourning\|Mourning]]. The cause of the [[02 - World/Mourning\|Mourning]] is still unknown; many fear it was the use of unregulated war magic. The shock and fear brought all the nations to the negotiating table, the Last war came to an end in 996 YK with the Treaty of Thronehold.

Though many where happy the war came to an end, many remained unsatisfied with the out come. No one had won the war. Its name may be the Last War, but most believe it's only a matter of time before the conflict begins a new. The mystery of the [[02 - World/Mourning\|Mourning]] is the only thing to keep the warmongers at bay. As of know the nation is in a state of cold war.

The year is currently 998 YK, and the scars of war have not left the land it has been 4 years since the [[02 - World/Mourning\|Mourning]] and less than 2 years since the end of The Last War. Most just want to move on.

The [[02 - World/Dragonmarked Houses\|Dragonmarked Houses]] remained neutral in the war and made considerable profits selling their services to all sides of the war. [[02 - World/Factions/Dragonmarked Houses/House Cannith\|House Cannith]] developed many new weapons during the war, including the [[Warforged\|Warforged]]. [[02 - World/Factions/Dragonmarked Houses/House Lyrander\|House Lyrander]] perfected [[Airships\|Airships]] in the last decade of the conflict. 

Before The Last War the [[02 - World/Dragonmarked Houses\|Dragonmarked Houses]] were under man restrictions imposed by Galifar. With the conclusion of The Last War the [[02 - World/Dragonmarked Houses\|Dragonmarked Houses]] emerged stronger than ever before. Today, no monarch can afford to break the ties with any of the [[02 - World/Dragonmarked Houses\|Dragonmarked Houses]].
