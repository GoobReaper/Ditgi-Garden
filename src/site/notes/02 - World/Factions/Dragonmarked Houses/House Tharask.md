Is a Human and Half- orc [[02 - World/Dragonmarked Houses\|Dragonmarked Houses]] that has recently begun spreading throughout [[02 - World/Continents/Main Continent/Khorvaire\|Khorvaire]], though it is still heavily based in the [[Shadow Marches\|Shadow Marches]].
Though the house is a union of orc and Shadow Marches human cultures, the house accepts anyone regardless of race, so long as they share their values. The house also takes in those who have no dragonmark and use them in the mercantile fields. Its members are renowned prospectors, bounty hunters, and treasure hunters. Its non-dragonmarked members make great investigators and guides.

**Business**
House Tharashk act as a proxy business for the [[Daughters of Sora Kell\|Daughters of Sora Kell]] by negotiating trade with the rest of Khorvaire for them. Anyone wanting to contract the monster laborers or mercenaries of Droaam must go through Tharashk. [[02 - World/Factions/Dragonmarked Houses/House Deneith\|House Deneith]] are in direct competition with Tharashk as they wish to wrestle the monster mercenaries out of their control. Though neither house admits to open conflict with each other, sabotage and secret operations occur often. House Tharashk makes a large amount of profit through prospecting and the sale of [[02 - World/Dragonshards\|Dragonshards]]. Additionally, many House Tharashk heirs become professional [[inquisitives\|inquisitives]] and can be hired
